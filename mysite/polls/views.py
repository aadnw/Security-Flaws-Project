# Without using raw SQL queries, we can prevent SQL injection.
# Django's querysets are protected because they are constructed using query parameterization.
# By filtering the questions so that the publish date is less or equal to this moment,
# users can't access data they shouldn't, like unpublished questions.
# This way broken access control is prevented.
# filter() method returns only the rows that match the search,
# also this way Django's ORM protects itself from SQL injection.

# Code with flaws is commented inside the functions. Fixed code is the not commented, actual code.

# SQL Injection is a vulnerability that could occur in all of the functions in this file.
# It is demonstrated only in the following function called "demonstrate_sql_injection".Â¨
# This function demonstrates how raw SQL queries shoudl not be used in any of this file's functions.
